LCD temperature

This project uses ATMega88 with connected LCD display to read and display 1-wire sensor temperatures.
Currently, the system is designed for 3 sensors.

The 1-wire Dallas/DS18B20 libraries are originally made by user rwatson in 2003 and modified to operate with current AVR-libraries.
